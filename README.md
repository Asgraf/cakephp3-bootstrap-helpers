CakePHP 3.0 Helpers to generate HTML with @Twitter Boostrap 3

This is the new repository for my CakePHP Bootstrap 3 Helpers (CakePHP 2.0 repository here: https://github.com/Holt59/cakephp-bootstrap3-helpers).

Working helpers: Html, Form, Modal, Paginator

<i>The <code>BootstrapNavbarHelper</code> is currently not working with CakePHP 3.</i>

How to use?
===========

Just add Helper files into your View/Helpers directory and load the helpers in you controller:
<pre><code>public $helpers = [
    'Html' => [
        'className' => 'BootstrapHtml'
    ],
    'Form' => [
        'className' => 'BootstrapForm'
    ],
    'Paginator' => [
        'className' => 'BootstrapPaginator'
    ],
    'Modal' => [
        'className' => 'BootstrapModal'
    ]
];</code></pre>

I tried to keep CakePHP helpers style. You can find the documentation directly in the Helpers files.
